Content is information that is directed towards an audience for consumption in a (digital) experience. Content is delivered through channels (or a particular medium), but the essence of content remains independent from the devliery medium.

In [Web Content Management by Deane Barker](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/web-content-management/9781491908112/ch01.html) two key differences between content and other digital information are pointed out:

> 1. Content is *created* differently
> 2. Content is *used* differently

These differences boil down to a number of key characteristics of content.

*Content is created by human editors* in an editorial process that involves creation, revision, and publishing.

*Content is created for human audiences*, which gives the content the ultimate value.
